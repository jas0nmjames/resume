## Notes from Bungee's Creator, David Jonathan Ross

> Bungee is a typeface that celebrates the urban sign. From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, vertical signage fills our cities. They stack the Latin alphabet, one letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space. Following their lead, I designed Bungee to be able to adapt to horizontal or vertical text, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.
