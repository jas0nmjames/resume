# Lexend

> Combining some of the newest technology in font software and an educated history in professional type design, Lexend pulls the most important typographic factors in reading-proficiency into a variable font that was designed specifically to fluctuate based on a reader’s Words Correct per Minute score — a typographic system that could be changed to make the words more readable, based on who’s reading them. - [lexend.com](https://www.lexend.com/)
