        <summary>Who I Am</summary>
        <p>👋 Hi! I’m a designer of conversations (CxD), user experiences (UX) and services (SD).</p>
        <p>I made my way to design after asking “How?” and “Why?” of society (BA, History) and business (MBA, Sustainability).</p>
        <p>User-centered design (UCD) is an opportunity to solve problems for people, especially in the industries, institutions and systems that shape our lives, like banking and tech.</p>
        <p>I find joy in tinkering.  I learn best when building from scratch, which often yields better questions and deeper understanding.</p>
        <p>I find joy in community.  I believe that <em>how</em> you build with others is as important as the end result.  My best lessons about pragmatic collaboration come from my previous life as a commercial construction manager.  Actually, no.  Probably my marriage.  Yeah.  Definitely my marriage.</p>
        <p>I prioritize spending time and energy with my brilliant wife and two boys.  In the time left over, you can find me on my bicycle or kayaking on South Florida’s waterways.</p>
        <p>I’m currently a Sr. User Experience & Conversation Designer at Santander Bank in Miami.</p>
