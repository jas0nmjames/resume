# Jason's Résumé

An evergreen résumé in html & css.

## Rationale

- Have a separate repository for just my resume which I can link to regardless of the state of my portfolio or where it's deployed from.
- Experiment with deploying with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) before I create my portfolio with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and deploy there
- Experiment with content focused design that is accessible, sustainability conscious and privacy friendly.
- Get something out the door without having to perfect my portfolio site (where I want to tweak my chatbot, connected it to ChatGPT, figure out the best way to present images, clean up asset naming, etc.)

## Goals

- [ ] Responsive
- [ ] Built with vanilla html & css
- [ ] Measure site size.  Check out [ecograder](https://ecograder.com/) or add the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) badge!
- [ ] Privacy-friendly analytics by [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)
- [ ] Title should float.  Understated, but adding a little motion to an otherwise static site. Inspiration from [Xavier](https://codepen.io/xavier_ho/pen/GRWZKpq).
- [ ] See [Fonts Playground](https://github.com/jas0nmjames/fonts-playground): [Bungee](https://djr.com/bungee)
